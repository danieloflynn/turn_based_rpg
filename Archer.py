    """Archer class. Inherits from Creature class

    Class Attributes:
    - default_attributes (dict[str, int]): Default attributes for this class, to be used if none supplied in constructor.
    - default_powerup (dict[str, int]): Default powerup attributes for this class, to be used as powerup_abilities if none supplied in constructor.

    Instance Attributes:
    - powerup_abilities (dict[str, int]): To be added to abilities when Archer "powers up" i.e. when power_shot is used.
    - powerUp (bool): Flag variable. Used to check if Archer is in power up/down state

    Methods:
    - attack: Same as normal attack. If in "powered up" state will power down, removing powerup buff.
    - power_shot: works like normal attack, except with better roll chances and bonuses. 
        Also adds powerup buff to current abilities (+3 attack -3 defence).
    - auto_select: Automatically selects target, given target list. See function for further details.
    - turn: Turn function for archer. See function for further details
